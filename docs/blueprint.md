# **App Name**: Seeker's Lens

## Core Features:

- Intelligent Query Analysis: Intelligently parses user's initial natural language input, URLs, or structured data to extract key entities (people, organizations, locations), concepts, implicit information needs, and potential linguistic/regional indicators. The LLM is utilized for advanced semantic analysis, disambiguation of terms, and accurately discerning the core investigative intent behind the user's input, preparing it for strategic query formulation. The LLM acts as a tool.
- Optimized Query Generation: Generates platform-specific (Google, Yandex) advanced search queries (dorks) based on the refined analysis. This includes dynamic adaptation for various information types (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, databases, specific file extensions), cultural contexts, and linguistic nuances (e.g., Cyrillic for Yandex, transliteration). It leverages an embedded understanding of search engine indexing, ranking algorithms, and specialized search verticals (e.g., Google Images/News/Scholar/Patents, Yandex.Images/.Maps/.Public). The LLM is employed for the contextual refinement of queries for each platform, helping to translate strategic OSINT knowledge into precise, effective search engine syntax and suggesting operators that align with the specific search engine's strengths for the given information need (e.g., Yandex's image analysis capabilities or Google's cached results). The LLM is used as a tool.
- Proactive Horizon Expansion: Suggests semantically related alternative search terms, synonyms, conceptual pivots, and analogous search strategies to broaden the investigation horizon and uncover less obvious information pathways. This can include suggestions for exploring related topics or different types of public records. The LLM acts as a tool to analyze the initial query and its components against a vast knowledge base, proposing relevant alternative searches, related entities, or parallel investigation lines that an expert might explore, effectively simulating an advanced brainstorming partner. The LLM acts as a tool.
- Strategic Query Modules: Offers pre-defined and customizable modules that generate sets of queries targeting specific OSINT objectives beyond basic keyword searching. Examples include: Digital Footprint Mapping, Vulnerability Probing (Ethical Dorking), Metadata Discovery, Archival & Historical Search. The LLM can assist in adapting these module templates to the specifics of the current query, ensuring the generated queries are highly relevant to the investigation. The LLM acts as a tool.
- Query Management & Workflow Integration: Allows users to save, categorize (e.g., by investigation, target, query type), tag, annotate, and manage generated query sets. Facilitates iterative searching by allowing easy modification and re-execution of queries. Supports organizing findings or linking queries to external notes.
- Clear Query Presentation & Export: Displays generated queries in a structured and understandable manner, grouped by search engine (Google, Yandex), intended search vertical (e.g., Web, Images, News, Files), and underlying OSINT strategy (e.g., Broad Scan, Deep Dive, Specific Filetype Hunt). Offers options to copy individual queries, copy all, or export query sets (e.g., as text, CSV).
- User Customization & Knowledge Base Extension: Allows users to add their own custom dorks, preferred query patterns, and even specific "known good" search strategies to a personal or team knowledge base within the application, tailoring Seeker's Lens to their specific expertise and operational needs.

## Style Guidelines:

- A clean, intuitive, multi-pane layout. Clearly defined zones for: Input & Initial Analysis, Generated Query Sets (categorized and filterable), Query Details & Modification, Investigation/Project Management.
- Professional and focused. Consider a primary neutral palette (e.g., greys, dark blues) with accent colors for calls to action, query types, or platform differentiation. A user-selectable dark mode is highly recommended for prolonged use.
- Clear, highly readable sans-serif font families (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Open Sans) for UI elements and data presentation.
- Monospaced font for query strings to ensure clarity of special characters and operators.
- Sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility.
- Use sharp, modern, and instantly recognizable icons related to search, analysis, intelligence, filtering, platforms (Google/Yandex logos subtly integrated where appropriate), and data management.
- Ensure consistency in icon style and weight.
